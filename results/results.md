Here are the scripts produced by our RNN. Files are named by category, e=number of epochs, and s=sequence length in characters. 

Starting input is "FROGS:" and the RNN was told to generate 12k characters + until generate a period. All RNNs were trained on a category composing of 5 anime each with 45-55k characters. The reason for the range is that we only wanted to use full episodes.
